1. The General Semantic Evolution of T and V
    - only tu in old Latin
    - vos first for emperor (maybe because 2 emperors, maybe because sometimes used nos)
    - plurality is old and ubiquitous metaphor for power
    - extended to other power figures, but lot of fluctuation
    A. the power semantic
        - power is nonreciprocal
        - one says T and gets V
        - pope, nobility, househead, parents, priests/penitents, God/angels, man/animals
        - V entered Europe as address to principal power of state, moved to parents
        - Freud said powers are father figs (personal exp is reverse)
    - but there is no rank for everyone; what if same?
    - reciprocal V became mark of elegance
    B. the solidarity semantic
        - T of intimacy and V of formality
        - symmetrical relation
        - dictated by like-mindedness/behaviour
        - earlier only applicable between equals; now more (authors examples conflict with ^)
        - earlier power more if conflict; now solidarity more
        - but the right to initiate reciprocal belongs to more-power wala
        - also now more relations allow T

2. Contemporary Differences among French, Italian and German
    - some differences in detailed usage today
    - differences tested for by-chance-ness
    - german T in fam > french
    - -> german T is ascribed solidarity
    - french T for camaraderie
    - -> french T for acquired solidarity
    - italian T ~ german in first and > french in second
    - #{solidarity attrs} incr -> T is more probable

3. Semantics, Social Structure and Ideology
    - non-reciprocal power semantic assoc. with a relatively static society: feudal, manorial systems
    - Lei, usted
    - tied to Church's teachings on aukaat
    - reciprocal solidarity semantic came with social mobility and equalitarian ideology
    - towns and cities
    - in France, T was universal after Revolution
    - because V was unpopular
    - still aware of power semantic in V: saying V to waiter is "shocking"
    - in England, ye became V in imitation of Fr
    - Quakers said thou to everyone; but minority
    - now they say thee to each other and you to others
    - ^ social structure
    - v ideology
    - in early communist yugoslavia, univ T; but now gone
    - but now "socialist manners" have asymmetry
    - Afrikaans society has power pronouns: more static society?
    - whites use T; coloureds say Meneer and blacks say Baas
    - Gujarati, Hindi between chettan/aniyan and bharya/bharthav; but going
    - in evolution, at one point, it was nicely 2-D. why gone?
    - tendency to avoid "contingencies" and devpmt of open egalitarian societies -> solidarity prevail
    - distate for ftf expression of differential power
    - but nonreciprocal forms of address exist. diff between those and pronouns?
    - "linguistic compulsion"
    - why pronominal coding more congenial to static society? problem at times of status change
    - ""tyranny of democratic manners""; "waiting room"
    - subordination is expressed in america by subtle (unwitting?) body language

4. Group Style with the Pronouns of Address
    - studied social-level-based style variation
    - languages are styles?
    - pronoun style used to expose pretensions of social climbers
    - SAI <-> solidary T
    - scalability: reproducibility of individual responses from a single score
    - a subset of items on questionnaire made a good scale; reproducibility 85%
    - 7 stylistically homogeneous groups -> radicalism
    - differences in style expressive of radicalism and conservatism
    - could be random (not ideological); but it could be related also

5. The Pronouns of Address as Expressions of Transient Attitudes
    - behaviour norms consistent within group
    - sometimes usages are individual
    - attitude/emotion
    - two principal kinds of expressive meaning (analogous to two dimensions): breaking power -> rank is different; breaking solidarity -> denying/affirming intimacy
    - T of contempt/anger; V of admiration/respect
    - Racine reserved expressive pronoun as some composers save the cymbals
    - verbal form created for thou of contempt; more common in England than continental
    - greater social distance <-> more shocking, greater extremity of passion
    - ironic or mocking "you"
    - but a momentary attitude can say a lot about general character asw
    - ^ power
    - v solidarity
    - sympathy vs estrangement is also possible
    - verona
    - Freud's amoeba metaphor: "extension or retraction of libidinal pseudopodia"
    - T once extended is almost never retracted
    - decline in expressive shifts? difficult to interpret
    - maybe because excluded people can become target of aggression
