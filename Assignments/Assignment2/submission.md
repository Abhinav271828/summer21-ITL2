## Explanation
There are two dimensions along which a Tonraq verb is conjugated: evidentiality and tense. A normal past-tense sentence has the form
    
    (subject) [verb phrase]–[evidential]–[tense]-pf

There are two evidential markers: `-zin-` and `-tenzin-`.  
`-zin-` indicates that the speaker either heard, read or deduced the statement; *i.e.*, the information is not firsthand. `-tenzin-` means that the speaker has firsthand information.

There are two tense markers: `-i-` and `-iroh-`.  
`-i-` is the "comparatively recent" tense marker, where the exact time frame is determined by the event. For instance, in the case of fish swimming by, it refers to a few hours; in the case of buildings, it could refer to a few years. `-iroh-` means that the event occurred further back in the past, again depending on context.

The word `korra` can be inserted anywhere in the sentence to indicate that the reference point of the verb's tense is not the present, but some other event. In C, this is the time at which he made the deduction about the fish swimming by; in F, it is the time he was on Ember Island.

The subject can be omitted if it is a pronoun.
