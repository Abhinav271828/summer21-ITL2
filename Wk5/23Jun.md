### Sense Relations – Sentences
Sentences are propositions, and the relation between them is examined in terms of truth values.  
There are two kinds of truth: empirical (aka synthetic; related to the real world) and logical (aka analytic; in the context of other sentences).  

As with word relations, we will not consider the empirical world and only talk about relations between the semantic values of sentences.

1. Synonymy: X and Y are synonymous if they have the same truth values. For example, _I own the phone_ and _The phone belongs to me_.  

2. Entailment: X entails Y if the logical relation X $\implies$ Y holds. For example, _She bought a new car_ entails _She bought a new automobile_.  
    Hyponymy is a common source of entailment.  
    
3. Contradiction: X is invariably false. For example, _This bachelor has a pretty wife_.  

4. Presupposition: It appears to be like entailment, but it borders on the realm of real world content – the presupposed statement is always true. For example, _I found the meeting boring_ presupposes _I attended the meeting_; but so does _I did not find the meeting boring_.   
    The above are positive presuppositions – the presupposed statement is assumed to be true. Examples of negative presupposition are _I wish you had worked harder for the test_, which assumes _You did not work hard for the test_.

Another important difference between presupposition and entailment is that entailment only applies to assertions, while presupposition can hold between other types of utterances as well.
