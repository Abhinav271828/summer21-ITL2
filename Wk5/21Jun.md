### Sense Relations – Words (contd.)
4. Near Synonymy (contd.): These pairs of words are not propositionally identical; it is not anomalous to assert one and deny another. For example, _He wasn't murdered, he was executed._ These groups often occur in clusters centred around a neutral word – _kill_  in this case.

5. Hyponymy: Two words, of which one is more general, and the other is included in it. For example, _dog_, _cat_ and _lion_ are hyponyms of _animal_. Much of the vocabulary is linked in this way, resulting in hierarchical taxonomies.  
    Words which are both hyponyms of the same word are taxonomic sisters.  
    Hyponymous terms entail the superordinate term.  
    
6. Meronymy: Two words which have a part-whole relationship – the object described by one forms a part of the object described by the other. For example, _car_ and _engine_.

7. Antonymy (meaning exclusion): Two words with opposite (and therefore incompatible) meanings. There are types of antonyms:
    
    * Simple antonyms: the negative of one implies the positive of the other, like _dead_ vs _alive_
    * Gradable antonyms: the above implication does not hold. For example, _rich_ vs _poor_ or _hot_ vs _cold_. The two major characteristics of these antonyms are:  
        (i) there are intermediate terms between two opposites: hot – warm – tepid – cool – cold
        (ii) the terms are relative: cold tea and warm beer could be at the same temperature.
        
    Sometimes one word is more basic than the other: _How long is the dog's tail?_ vs _How short is the dog's tail?_.

8. Reverses: These are similar to antonyms, but for directions, motions or processes. For example, _push_ vs _pull_, _right_ vs _left_, or _fill_ vs _empty_.

9. Converses: These terms descrive a relation between two entities from alternate points of view, like _own_ vs _belong_ or _teacher_ vs _student_.
