### Sense Relations – Sentences (contd.)
5. Tautology: X is semantically vacuous and carries no real information as it is invariably true. For example, _This bachelor has no wife._ Such sentences can be used in speech because of connotations; for instance, _Boys will be boys._  
6. Anomaly: X presupposes a contradiction. For example, _He chased his own widow out of the house._

## Structure of Sentences
Sentences and words are only morphosyntactic categories; this may not be an optimal categorisation for semantic study.

Semantic analysis is done using the following 3-tier system of units:

* predication: it roughly corresponds to a sentence, and has a truth/falsehood value.
* cluster: it roughly corresponds to a word or a phrase and is the upper limit of componential analysis. hypnonymy, incompatibility etc. apply to this level.
* features: the minimal differentiating factors of meaning (analogous to distinctive features in phonology).

Predications are analysed into clusters, which are in turn analysed into features.  
Clusters are either arguments or predicates; arguments are the logical participants and predicates are the linking elements. For example, in _My mother reads poetry._, the arguments are _my mother_ and _poetry_, and the predicate is _reads_.

A predication can have one argument or multiple.

The analysis of clusters into features is necessary in order to explain semantic relations like entailment. For example, consider _Adam boiled an egg._ _boiled_ could be analysed as `cook` + `in water` + `past`; only then one can explain why it entails _Adam cooked an egg._

An analysis similar to this shows the contradiction in _Colourless green ideas sleep furiously._ However, for this, we need to have an understanding of the semantic relations between the various parts of the sentence. The Indian grammatical tradition has just such a system.  

Consider the sentence _The girl in the forest was digging for roots with a spade yesterday._  
Here, the arguments are _the girl_, _the forest_, _roots_, _a spade_ and _yesterday_.  
What connects these five arguments is the action, indicated by the predicate _was digging_.  

The arguments (_prakrti_), which are essentially participants in the action; their specific roles are _kārakas_. Further, the arguments combine with the action through a word that indicate their exact role (like _in_, _for_ or _with_), called _pratyaya_.

In this sentence,

* _the girl_, the agent, has the _kāraka_ K1
* _the forest_, the spatial location, has K7p
* _roots_, the patient, has K2
* _the spade_,  the instrument, has K3
* _yesterday_, the temporal location, has K7t
