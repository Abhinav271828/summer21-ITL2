## Language as a Conceptual System
The relation between language and thought has been the subject of debate for centuries.  
"Thinking" involves categorising, cognising and re-cognising one's surroundings, which is done through language. This is the essence of "being".  
Therefore, language is (besides an instrument of communication) a means to classify and impose a structure on the world around us – a conceptual system.  

It has been claimed that different languages conceptualise the world differently. One commonly studied topic is the semantics of colour terms – various languages cut the spectrum at different points. For example, Hindi _baińganī_ corresponds to "purple", "violet", "mauve" and "lavender" in English; and _lāl_ to "red", "crimson", and "scarlet". Similarly for kinship terms, actions, edibles, and so on.  

None of these systems is more "logical" than the other.
