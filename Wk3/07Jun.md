## Relations
We have noted that we cannot study language in terms of non-linguistic entities, and therefore only talk about relationships among linguistic units.  

### Sense Relations – Words
These are paradigmatic relations.  

1. Homonymy (or homophony): Two or more words with the same phonetic form but having unrelated meaning. Homonyms are actually words which have the same spelling, but it is a fine distinction.  
    Partial homonymy occurs when forms are identical but other conditions may not be satisfied, *e.g.* _find_ and _found_; or _leave_ and _leaf_.  
    Types of homonyms are  
    (i) same syntactic category and same spelling: _lap_;
    (ii) same syntactic category and different spelling: *sun* vs *son*;
    (iii) different categories and same spelling: *keep*;
    (iv) different categories and different spellings: *not* vs *knot*.
