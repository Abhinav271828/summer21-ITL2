### Sense Relations – Words (contd.)
2. Polysemy: Two or more words with the same semantic form but having _related_ meaning, *i.e.* having a single dictionary entry. For example, _issue_ in the following sentences  
        (i) The river Kaveri issues from Thalakaveri.  
        (ii) The last issue of India Today...  
        (iii) The RBI issues new notes.  
    But it has a different meaning in  
        (i) You have too many issues in life.  
        (ii) The issue for today's discussion...  
        (iii) Don't make an issue of it!  
    
3. Meaning Inclusion: Two or more words that include the same or very similar meanings. There can be different distribution along a number of parameters:  
        (i) Regional/Social dialects: fall/autumn; _krodh_/_kop_/_gussa_  
        (ii) Euphemisms: die/pass away/expire  
        (iii) Formal/Literary/Colloquial registers  
    
4. Near Synonymy: Two or more words which are similar in some contexts but not in others; for example, _buy_ vs _purchase_ in "buy/purchase a house", but not "buy an argument".
