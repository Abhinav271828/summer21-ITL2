## Meaning
Various examples (Ogden and Richards' 22 definitions) show that there is disagreement over the most basic of terms. There is no unique way to refer to objects/events in the real word.  
Words are always evolving new nuances and connotations; for example, _ajñātavāsam_ in Telugu came to assume the meaning of "hiding underground (from the Naxals)".

Meaning doesn't always lie in words, for instance in metaphorical speech.  

## The Modern Approach
There is no escape from language; the definitions of linguistic expressions are all in terms of other linguistic expressions. There is no correspondence with anything outside language.  
Therefore, we study relations within language – lexical semantics and grammatical relations.
