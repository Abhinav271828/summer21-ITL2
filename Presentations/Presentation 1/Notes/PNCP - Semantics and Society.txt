Summary

Five Functions of Language
- informational: everyone assumes cool
        ~ conceptual
- expressive   : feelings & attitudes (swear words, exclamations)
        ~ affective
- directive    : influence others
        ~ affective and connotative
- aesthetic    : for the sake of itself
        ~ conceptual and affective, but important that all ways are open
- phatic       : keeping social bonds alive

 • not a unique classification, but interesting because of the correlation with the essential features of a communicative situation:
        - subject-matter
        - originator
        - receiver
        - channel of communication
        - message itself
   respectively.

 • in social roles of language, expressive+directive+phatic are most involved.
 • expressive and directive often go together

Conceptual vs Affective Meaning
 • there is an overlap between c. and a. meaning; especially in emotional/evaluative speech
 • but if these are conveyed by associative meanings, 2 dangers:
        - miscomm, misund <- connotations and associative meaning vary
        - associative predomins over conceptual => receiver "taken in"
 • affective meaning is covert and implicit; we cannot disagree or say "i don't feel that way" if it is not explicitly expressed. we only feel the need to respond but know not how to argue.
 • words differing in associative meaning are most infamously those for social groups: nationalities ("americans"), religions ("catholic") and most dangerously political ideologies ("anarchism", "communism", "liberal"). dictionary sense may even be almost forgotten. takes over completely with words like "democracy"
 • (Lang in Thought n Action, Hayakawa): snarl words "conceptual meaning becomes irrel. because user is capitalising on connotations to express hostility" (extreme/uncompromising polit. views, communist, fascist); purr words (democratic, freedom, h. rights, patriotic, equality)
 • other snarl words are niggers, yanks, reds, pigs, etc

"Associative Engineering": Euphemism and Image-Building
 • euphemism: "linguistic equivt of disinfectant"
 • disease, indisposition, concentration camp
 • almost opp of snarl word: minimise damaging affective associations
 • but never works out, it just keeps shifting: lavatory, privy, WC, toilet, cloakroom, restroom, comfort station, loo
 • some labels are not just nice names for nasty things; they pick out the +ve/optimistic aspects of the thing and downplay the bad stuff, like "emergent nations", "apartheid". this is associative engineering
 • modern advertising's image-building: names, phrasing, choice of words
 • but even this issue is liable to arguments involving conceptual meaning

"Conceptual Engineering"
 • propaganda also recruits the favourable associations of the conceptual meaning; it's like the tail wagging the dog
 • so c. engg becomes a part of a. engg
 • the distinction between "violence" and "force" is one such
 • "rebuke" and "reprimand"
 • possible because the meanings of abstract words are ~indeterminate. always room for disagreement.
 • "definition by partisan fiat"
 • "political prisoner", "military action"

"Position"
 • strategic semantics is more elaborate in the case of arguments for attitudes
 • propaganda pieces are analogous to proofs, but links are associative not conceptual. this is the "position".
 • the strength of affective bias = number of ways to prove "we are good" from associative assumptions/postulates.
 • kind of "euphemistic propaganda"; in a way renames the phenomenon/policy by association to more neutral terms.
 • the relation between position and argumentation is sometimes overt, sometimes not
 • example of latter is presuppositions (contained in noun phrases)
 • advantage: the position is presented as a matter of common knowledge; no one should question

The Phatic Function
 • function of maintaining cohesion rather than spreading disharmony
 • phatic communic. is important but dull
 • importance of keeping a list of inoffensive assertions - weather
 • small-talk is analogous to mutual grroming among monkeys: very important cooperative behaviour, but used disproportionately often!
 • this is one explanation ^
 • another is that phatic communication is an adult substitute for cuddling; the need for reassurance is satisfied by verbal not physical contact
 • a conversation is a "mutual stroking ritual"; there's a balance.
 • the phatic function might be equated to the avoidance of unrequited silence.
 • thus the importance of jokes, witticisms, etc.
 • political speeches that convey nothing, "full and frank talks on a wide range of subjects of mutual interest"
 • satisfying the media/public's need for statement without revealing anything
 • contrasts with more militant propaganda statements.
 • esp. also ceremonial speeches by HoSs.

Language as a Substitute for Action?
 • one is as above: phatic ~ stroking/grooming
 • verbal insult ~ shaking of fist
 • verbal attempt to change behaviour ~ brute coercion
 • a defence of the UN's history of dispute: it is a substitute for full-on war.
 • General Semantics: misuse of lang is a major cause of conflict and danger to future
 • author: this attitude leads to an over-optimistic faith in the curative powers of semantics
 • but if inflammatory language were somehow banned, brute force might become first and not last resort.
 • but overemphasis on affective meaning is a perversion of language; the aspect of meaning that is the basis of communication should not be subservient to emotion and prejudice.
 • "semantic alertness" is needed.

Summary
- five functions
- looked at directive, phatic
- directive language (prop): affective, associative power of words; conceptual meaning subordinated
- phatic: not content, but existence of message. conceptual meaning is out again
- but not so that man is slave and language the tyrant. is a back and forth. train ourselves to responsible and critical scrutiny.
