### Presentation 2 (11 June, Friday) – The Language Glass

Presented by LyonsGate

## Language and Culture
Language influences and reflects culture.

## A Man of Culture
All languages are able to express anything; or, if it is inconvenient, this only boils down to a lack of specialised vocabulary. Many languages borrowed words from others.

## Case Studies
There are languages which use only cardinal directions, and have no egocentric words.

## Logic and Clarity

## Language: Reflects or Influences
It is agreed that the language one speaks has no highly fundamental influence on one's thought. All languages share the same complexity.

## Nihilism
We need to believe in God.

## Labels
Labels for objects in various languages are nothing but cultural conventions.
The debate is whether language is an artifact of culture or a bequest of nature.

## Experiments and Case Studies
The gender of words in a language affects the way speakers of the language think about it.
