## Discourse Semantics
### Cohesive Relations
Utterances are cohesive and related to each other in context.  

Cohesive relationships within a text occur when the interpretation of some element in the discourse is dependent on that of another.  

There are various types of cohesive relationships:

* additive: _and_, _furthermore_; in Hindi, [इसी तरह]{lang=hi}
* adversative: _but_, _however_; in Hindi, [लेकिन]{lang=hi}
* causal: _so_, _for this reason_; in Hindi, [ताकि]{lang=hi}
* temporal: _then_, _afterwards_; in Hindi, [फिर]{lang=hi}

It is not necessary that a certain marker should exhibit only one cohesive relationship. What is important is the underlying semantic relation, which actually has the cohesive power.

### Coreference
Coreferential forms make reference to something else for their interpretation – they direct the receiver to look elsewhere.  

There is a classification of coreference:

* exophora: reference to an entity outside conversation for the first time.
* endophora: reference to a mention of an entity that has been or will be made in the context, which is of two types:
    - anaphora: reference to a previous mention, and
    - cataphora: reference to an upcoming mention.

Anaphoric relationships can hold in many ways:

* repeated forms: _Mamta Banerjee thanked the voters. Mamta Banerjee was full of gratitude towards them._
* partially repeated forms: _The PM Narendra Modi gave his talk. Modi spoke well._
* lexical replacement: _He proposed to her again. The idiot can't take a hint._
* pronominal form: _Rohith went out. He came back an hour later._
* substituted form: _Vijay ate a pineapple. Shekhar ate one too._
* elided form: _Vijay ate a pineapple. Shekhar did toall do o._

### Conjunctive Participle
In Indian languages, the conjunctive participle is often used to join utterances. It is used to indicate:

* sequential action: as in [बाज़ार जाके, सब्ज़ी ख़रीदके, घर गया]{lang=hi}
* manner of action: as in [चिल्ला-चिल्लाकर सबको स्कीम बता दे]{lang=hi}
* reason/cause of action: as in [खा-खाकर मोटा हो गया]{lang=hi}
* means for action: as in [रिक्षा लेकर आए थे]{lang=hi}

Repetition of the verb is commonly used in the conjunctive participle; in Hindi, the suffix is attached only to the second verb, but in Bangla or Telugu it is attached to both.
