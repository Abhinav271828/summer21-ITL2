## Entailment and Presupposition
The truth table of entailment (X entails Y) is as follows:  

| X | Y |
| :---: | :---: |
| T $\implies$ | T |
| F $\implies$ | T |
| T or F $\gets$ | T |

while that of presupposition (X presupposes Y) is:  

| X | Y |
| :--: | :--: |
| T $\implies$ | T |
| F $\implies$ | T or F |
| F $\gets$ | F |
| T or F $\gets$ | T |

## Conversational Implicature (contd.)
### Grice's Maxims (contd.)
Grice's Maxims make it apparent that language is one of the many aspects of human social behaviour that depend substantially on co-operation. Another example of language in the context of co-operative behaviour is Searle's sincerity condition for felicity of speech acts.
