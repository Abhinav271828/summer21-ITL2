## Deixis (contd.)
There are two kinds of deictic usage: gestural and symbolic.  
Gestural usage can only be interpreted with reference to something audio-visual-tactile, generally a physical monitoring of the speech event, for example, _This one is gold and this one is silver._ Symbolic usage needs a knowledge of only the broad spatio-temporal parameters of the event, as in _We didn't get summer vacation this year._

The same word can be used in all ways; for instance,

* _You, you, but not you, will get vaccinated._ [gestural]
* _What did you say?_ [symbolic]
* _You can always predict the rain._ [non-deictic]

_this_ is another such word.

Social deixis lies beyond the scope of truth-conditional semantics. There are aspects of linguistic structure that encode the social identities of the participants. The most obvious grammaticalisation of social deixis are titles of address and pronouns.
