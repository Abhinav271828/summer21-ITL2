## Deixis (contd.)
One's identity is deeply connected with "face". All participants in communication have "face needs" – positive face needs (which are the need to maintain one's face), and negative face needs (which are the prevention of intrusion into one's space).  
Language helps to mitigate FTA or face-threatening acts; for instance, saying _I wonder if you can take me to the airport._ rather than _Take me to the airport._

### Titles of Address
Common respectful ways of address are to use words like "Mr", "Mrs", "Sir" or "Ma'am". In India, words like _ji_, _shri_, _tiru_, and _bhaiya_ are used.

### Pronouns
The T-V distinction is common in many languages. The distinction has been lost in English, however. Indian languages all have their versions of this distinction as well.  
There are also humiliative forms, where one lowers one's own status to raise the addressee's status.  
The use of respectful pronouns is sometimes implicit in the verb form as well.
