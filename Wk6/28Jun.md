## Pragmatics
We will now consider how language is used in communication. This is a departure from Chomsky's model.  
The abstract formal system of language (grammar) and the principles of its use (pragmatics) are complementary domains in linguistics.  

Semantics does not account for the peculiar uses of phrases, like _ātā hū_ when someone is leaving. It is a dyadic system: **What** does **x** mean? Pragmatics is a triadic system: **What** do **you** mean by **x**?

A lot of meaning is included in the context, and not only the meanings of the words. For instance, deictic words grammaticalise features of the context of the utterance.

## Deixis
Deixis can be personal (pronouns), spatial (adverbs of location, verbs like _come_ and _go_) or temporal.
